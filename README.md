This is a small command-line tool that runs some checks on remote servers and
posts the results to a Slack channel.

Check the [project's website](https://www.rvhonorato.me/remotesysmonitor) for a
full list of [available checks](https://www.rvhonorato.me/remotesysmonitor/remotesysmonitor/checks)
and how to configure them.

## TL:DR

### Install

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed, if not follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
cargo install remotesysmonitor
```

### Execute

Check the output of the `remotesysmonitor --help` command for a list of available
options.

```bash
$ remotesysmonitor -h
Usage: remotesysmonitor [OPTIONS] <CONFIG>

Arguments:
  <CONFIG>

Options:
  -f, --full     Post a check to Slack even if there is no ❌ in the checks
  -p, --print    Print the output of the checks in stdout
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

You need to define `SLACK_HOOK_URL` as an environment variable with the URL of the
Slack webhook you want to use and a path to the configuration file.

```bash
SLACK_HOOK_URL=<your-slack-hook-url> remotesysmonitor configuration.yaml
```

The configuration file should look like this:

```yaml
servers:
  - name: name-of-your-server
    host: myserver.nl
    port: 22
    user: rodrigo
    private_key: /home/rodrigo/.ssh/id_ed25519
    checks:
      ping:
        url:
          - /
      load:
        interval: 15
        warning_cutoff: 50.0
      number_of_subfolders:
        path:
          - /path/full/of/subfolders
      custom_command:
        command: cd /some/path && ./some_script.sh
      list_old_directories:
        loc: /path/full/of/old/directories
        cutoff: 2 # days

  - name: raspberryPi
    host: ip.of.your.raspberry.pi
    port: 22
    user: rodrigo
    private_key: /home/rodrigo/.ssh/id_ed25519
    checks:
      temperature:
        sensor: /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000b694311/w1_slave
```

It might make sense to configure a cron job to run this command periodically.

```bash
# Run every 10 minutes, it will only post to Slack if one of the checks has ❌
*/10 * * * * SLACK_HOOK_URL=<your-slack-hook-url> remotesysmonitor configuration.yaml

# Post a full report to Slack at 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours
## Running with -f will post to Slack even if there is no ❌ in the checks
0 8,12,16,20 * * * SLACK_HOOK_URL=<your-slack-hook-url> remotesysmonitor -f configuration.yaml
```
