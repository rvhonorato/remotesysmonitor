/// Executes a check to count the number of folders in specified paths on a remote server.
///
/// This function connects to a remote server via SSH and runs a command to count the number
/// of directories in the given paths. It formats the results into a string, where each line
/// corresponds to one of the input paths. Each line reports the number of folders found and
/// is prefixed with an emoji to visually indicate the result: a green check mark (✅) indicates
/// no folders were found, a red cross (❌) indicates folders were found, and "❌ Error:" is
/// prefixed if an error occurred during command execution.
///
/// The function leverages the `find` command on the remote server to count directories directly,
/// minimizing the overhead and potential for misinterpretation compared to listing and manually
/// counting entries.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `sess` - A reference to an established SSH `Session` for executing commands on the remote server.
/// * `server_name` - The name of the server where the check is performed. This is used for reporting
///   results and does not affect the execution of the SSH command.
/// * `paths` - A slice of `String` objects, each representing a path on the remote server to check
///   for the number of folders.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns a `String` containing the results of the check for each path. Each line in the returned
/// string reports the number of folders found in the corresponding path, prefixed with an emoji to
/// visually indicate the presence of folders or an error. The lines are formatted as follows:
/// - "✅ No folders @ `server_name:path`" if no folders are found,
/// - "❌ 1 folder @ `server_name:path`" if exactly one folder is found,
/// - "❌ N folders @ `server_name:path`" for N > 1 folders found,
/// - "❌ Error: error_description" if an error occurs during the execution of the SSH command.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let session = // Assume `session` is an established SSH `Session`.
/// let server_name = "example_server";
/// let paths = vec![String::from("/path/to/directory1"), String::from("/path/to/directory2")];
/// let result = number_of_folders(&session, server_name, &paths);
/// println!("{}", result);
/// ```
///
/// This will execute the folder count check for each path specified in `paths` on `example_server`
/// and print the results, one per line, with appropriate emojis indicating the outcome.
///
/// # Note
///
/// The function assumes that `ssh::run_ssh_command` can successfully connect and execute commands
/// on the remote server. It handles command execution failures by including an error message in the
/// output string. This function does not catch panics from parsing the command output, which should
/// be considered when interpreting the results.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `sess` - A reference to an established SSH `Session` for executing commands on the remote server.
/// * `server_name` - The name of the server where the command is executed. This is used for formatting

/// * `warning_cutoff` - The maximum value the load can be before an "❌" is triggered

/// # Errors
///
/// If the `uptime` command fails to execute or if the output cannot be parsed to extract the load average,

/// ```rust
/// let session = // Assume `session` is an established SSH `Session`.

/// # Notes
///
/// - The function assumes that the `ssh::run_ssh_command` function is available and correctly set up
///   to execute SSH commands.
/// - The choice of 50.0 as the threshold for determining high load is arbitrary and may not be suitable
///   for all systems. Consider adjusting this threshold based on your system's capacity and typical loads.

///
/// * `host` - A string slice representing the base host to which the URL path segments will be appended.
